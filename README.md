zipkin-infrastructure
=====================

All components needed to run Zipkin in Docker containers (Cassandra, Collector, Query, Web, and FB-Scribe)
We build a Zipkin base container installing scala and zipkin.
From this docker image, we derive the specific zipkin parts to combine a zipkin infrastructure.
Directorey fb-scribe will generate a facebook [scribe](https://github.com/facebookarchive/scribe) service 
ready to communicat with zipkin collector. The same functionallity can be obtained by using a [Scala Akka Tracing](https://github.com/levkhomich/akka-tracing) mechanism.

### Zipkin Port Structure
As we store the tracing data in a cassandra DB, we first of all start this container naming it `zipkin-cassandra` as defined by `NAME_PRFIX` in [config.sh](https://github.com/elemica/zipkin-infrastructure/blob/master/script/config.sh) and link  `zipkin-collector`, `zipkin-query` and `zipkin-web` to it.
All ports we use are defined in  [config.sh](https://github.com/elemica/zipkin-infrastructure/blob/master/script/config.sh).

*Ports exposed through shell scripts*

| Variable| Port| Exposed by | Description |
|:---------|:---------|:-------|:-------| 
| `COLLECTOR_PORT`| 9410| `zipkin-collector`| linked internally to talk to `zipkin-cassandra`| 
| `COLLECTOR_MGT_PORT`| 9900 | `zipkin-collector`| linked internally to talk to `zipkin-cassandra`|
| `QUERY_PORT` | 9411|  `zipkin-query`| linked internally to talk to `zipkin-cassandra`|
| `WEB_PORT`| 8080| `zipkin-web`| to be accessed by a browser to surf the zipkin web UI|

*Ports exposed through Dockerfiles*

| Container| Port|  Description |
|:---------|:---------|:-------| 
| `zipkin-cassandra`| 9160| [Thrift client API](http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/FAQ#ports) for RPC| 
| `zipkin-cassandra`| 7000| [Gossip](http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/FAQ#ports) to find other cassandra instanced in the cluster| 
| `zipkin-cassandra`| 7001| [Gossip](http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/FAQ#ports) with SSL | 
| `zipkin-cassandra`| 9042| [CQL](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2359159/cassandra-port-usage-how-are-the-ports-used) Cassandra Query Language| 
| `zipkin-cassandra`| 7199| [JMX](http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/JmxInterface) to view and tweak variables which it exposes via [Java Management Extension](http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/core/mntr-mgmt/javamanagement/) | 
| `zipkin-collector`| 9410| listening for tracing messages, written by `fb-scribe` or an AKKA application | 
| `zipkin-collector`| 9900|  management port to manage `zipkin-collector`| 
| `zipkin-query`| 9411| [Query Service](https://github.com/twitter/zipkin/search?q=9411&type=Code) port for the query service to listen on |
| `zipkin-web`| 8080| [Web Frontend](https://github.com/twitter/zipkin/search?q=8080&ref=cmdform) port for the zipkin web front end | 
| `zipkin-fb-scribe`| 22|  | 
| `zipkin-fb-scribe`| 1463|  listening for spans for the tracing messages| 

#### AWS security group
As cassandra uses many ports a possible AWS security group is described by [DATASTAX](http://www.datastax.com/documentation/cassandra/2.0/cassandra/install/installAMISecurityGroup.html).

######TODO 
 * Check for container link between web and query?
 * Configure linking between fb-scribe (or akka) and collector (`COLLECTOR_PORT`) running on different docker hosts.

#### Notes

Docker-Zipkin starts the services in their own container: zipkin-cassandra,
zipkin-collector, zipkin-query, zipkin-web and only link required dependencies
together.

The started Zipkin instance would be backed by a single node Cassandra. By
default, the collector port is not mapped to public. You will need to link
containers that you wish to trace with zipkin-collector or you may change the
respective line in deploy.sh to map the port.

All images with the exception of zipkin-cassandra are sharing a base image:
[base](https://github.com/elemica/zipkin-infrastructure/tree/master/base). zipkin-base and zipkin-cassandra are built on ubuntu:12.04.

Once the containers are running you can connect to the collector on
port 9410 via akka-tracing or other libraries that support Zipkin tracing.

#### Dockerfile
We try to place as many installation commands into Docker files, to ease the build process:
 * Each build step is frozen as an intermediate container
 * Errors during build don`t require rerunning it completely
 * Testing new install instructions start from a partly build process and thus run faster
